# Useful Python Scripts

## Details on Python Scripts
Feel free to use these scripts in your projects. 

## Python Versions
I have created two versions for each script to run on Python 2 and Python 3. The file names for Python 2 and Python 3 would have the suffixes _p2 and _p3 respectively. If the file runs on both Python 2 and Python 3, there will be no suffix _p2 and _p3.
