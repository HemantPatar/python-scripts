# Useful Python Scripts

## Details on Python Scripts
Feel free to use these scripts in your projects. 

## Python Versions
I have created two versions for each scripts to run on Python 2 and Python 3. The file names for Python 2 and Python 3 would have the suffixes _p2 and _p3 respectively. If the file runs on both Python 2 and Python 3, there will be no suffix _p2 and _p3.

### Scripts Available
1. Normal Hours and Overtime Salary Computation (compute_pay_overtime_gross_p2.py & compute_pay_overtime_gross_p3.py)
2. Seeking Smallest and Largest Number (find_smallest_largest_num_p2.py and find_smallest_largest_num_p3.py)
3. Total, Average and Count Computation
4. Collate list of unique words from a text file
5. Calculate the most common word from a text file
6. Seeking email timing frequency from email logs (text file)
